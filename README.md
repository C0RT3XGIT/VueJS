### About project
```
This is a to do list application. Btw I've tried to fetch different data from "jsonplaceholder.typicode.com" - the result can we viewed in 'API Json' tab.
I have also used Vuex to store fetched data globally. Some getter was created to compute derived state that could be accessed from whole project in future.
